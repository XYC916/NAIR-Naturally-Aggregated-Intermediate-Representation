# NAIR-Naturally-Aggregated-Intermediate-Representation
Official Implementation of paper "NAIR: Naturally Aggregated Intermediate Representation based Efficient Distributed Deep Learning Architecture"

NAIR aims to naturally amplify the difference in importance of the intermediate representation from a mature deep model, and reassemble the intermediate representation into a hierarchy of importance from 
high-to-low to accommodate the transmission loss.

This efficient aggregation method for intermediate representation shows improved performance in various scenarios and avoids compromising the overall inference performance of the system.

It achieves more than doubled performance over the state-of-the-art work.
